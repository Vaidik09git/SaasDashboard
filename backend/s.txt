1. Core Financial KPIs
These should be the "Big Numbers" at the very top of the performance dashboard.

Total Revenue: The gross income generated by the business.

Net Profit & Margin: Revenue minus all expenses, displayed as a currency value and a percentage.

Operating Expenses (OpEx): A breakdown of where the money is going (e.g., salaries, rent, software).

Burn Rate & Runway: Specifically for SaaS startups, show how much cash is spent monthly and how many months of funding remain.

2. Growth & Trend Analysis
Use line charts to show directionality over time.

Month-over-Month (MoM) Growth: A percentage increase or decrease in revenue compared to the previous month.

Revenue vs. Expenses Trend: A dual-line chart showing if the gap between income and spending is widening (profitable) or closing.

Seasonality Detection: Highlighting which months or quarters historically perform the best based on the uploaded data.

3. SaaS-Specific Performance
If the uploaded file contains subscription data, these are essential:

MRR/ARR: Monthly Recurring Revenue and Annual Recurring Revenue.

Churn Rate: The percentage of customers who cancelled their service.

CLV (Customer Lifetime Value): The total amount of money a customer is expected to spend with the business.

CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost): How much it costs to gain one new customer.

4. Operational Efficiency
Revenue per Employee: Total revenue divided by head count to measure productivity.

Top Expense Categories: A pie chart showing the "Top 5" areas draining the company's budget.

Accounts Receivable (A/R) Aging: Showing how much money is owed to the company and for how long.
